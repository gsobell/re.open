# re:open

Since I use a WM, I have keybindings for my most used actions. However, can get a bit trigger happy with the `mod1 + q`, which force quits the focused X11 program.

I was looking for a solution similar to the `ctrl-shift-t` to reopen closed tabs on most modern browsers, and stumbled across [this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/883376/is-there-a-shortcut-to-re-open-a-recently-closed-program). The only issue is it would have to run on a cron job or similar.

And as if to prove a point, while working on this, I closed all the programs on the focused desktop; thanks to vim swap, nothing was lost.
